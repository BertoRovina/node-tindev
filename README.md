# Tindev

----
## What is this project?
The project is a version of Tinder but for developers who are looking for a Startup partner! It makes requests to the GitHub api and gathers data from a user that tries to login in. Then, all other users are displayed and they all have the option to Like/Dislike the users that they see.

The project has a desktop version as well as a mobile version for iOS and Android.

(The project was developed based on an online course by RocketSeat and had personalizations added to it and still under development as I learn more about these technologies)
